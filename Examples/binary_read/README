Test program for demonstrating reading in binary data into python from fortran. 
The important note is that in the fortran write the access type must be 
'direct'. If this is not the case it will not work.

To run the program simple run the ipython notebook. This will compile and 
execute the fortran code and then read the data arrays into python. The data 
output from fortran is then deleted.
